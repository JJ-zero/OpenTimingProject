## Notex to the 3D models
- All models are designed to print on my Prusa Mini+. You may need to adjust some offsets or sizes.
- The fits for components are not "pressfit" precise. You may need to adjust the sizes or use glue. Just a bit of hotglue worked for me.
- The `Top` is designed for trasparent filament to allow the LEDs to shine through. You may try to play with your slices settings to get desired effect. More infill will better refract the light but make it less bright.
- Near the spot for a charging module are two holes. You can insert a bit of trasparent filament as a light guide to make a "charging" indicator. Heat the filament to get in in place. 
- ESP8266 and the battery does not have a dedicated spot. I used just hotflued it in. Beaware that the 18650 fits super tight and you can not have any wires under or over it.
